## def

Dynamic programming applies to optimization or combinational problems by subdividing problems into smaller ones and utilizing previously calculated solutions to save computational time.

Common steps:

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information

If number of subproblems is polynomial then the running time will be polynomial too.

top down -> recursive
