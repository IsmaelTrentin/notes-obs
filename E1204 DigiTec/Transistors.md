## nMOS

Given $G_{i}$ as the gate input and $O_{t}$ as the transistor output:

$$
\begin{align}
G_{i} = 0 \iff O_{t} = 0 \\
G_{i} = 1 \iff O_{t} = 1
\end{align}
$$

Since nMOS pass good 0s, they connect source to $GND$.

## pMOS

Given $G_{i}$ as the gate input and $O_{t}$ as the transistor output:

$$
\begin{align}
G_{i} = 0 \iff O_{t} = 1 \\
G_{i} = 1 \iff O_{t} = 0
\end{align}
$$

Since pMOS pass good 1s, they connect source to $V_{DD}$.
