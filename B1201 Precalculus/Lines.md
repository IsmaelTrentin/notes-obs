## Line

$$
f(x)=mx+q
$$

$$
m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

A negative $m$ results in a downward tilt while a positive $m$ results in an upward tilt. Also defined as the movement on the $x$ and $y$ axes, i.e. 4 to the right and 1 up is $m=\frac{1}{4}$.

Having two functions: $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, if:

$$
m_{f} \cdot m_{g} = -1
$$

The two lines are **perpendicular**.

$$
q = f(0)
$$

The variable $q$ is responsible for the vertical translation of the graph.

### Horizontal Lines

$$
x=a
$$

### Implicit form.

$$
ax + by + c = 0
$$

refac tip:

m.(x - Px) + Py

## [[üõ†Ô∏è]] Applications

### Crosses point $P: P=(x;y)$

$$
\frac{x-x_{1}}{y - y_{1}}= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}
$$
