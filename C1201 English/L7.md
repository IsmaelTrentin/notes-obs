The transition from silent movies to talkies in the mid 1920s was a major development that revolutionized Hollywood. The rise in talking movies changed many things in the film industry, from how they were recorded to the cinemas themselves. In the era of silent movies, most films were accompanied by live orchestras. Therefore, movie theaters needed to install new equipment to show the new sound-projected films. In addition, the orchestras were no longer needed, so roughly 20000 musicians ended up losing their jobs.
