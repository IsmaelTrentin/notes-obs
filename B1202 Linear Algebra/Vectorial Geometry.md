## Points and [[Vectors]]

[[Vectors]] can be built using points' coordinates. Given two points $A, B$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the vector $\vec{AB}$ can be built like so:

$$
\vec{AB} = \begin{bmatrix}
B_{x} - A_{x} \\
B_{y} - A_{y} \\
B_{z} - A_{z} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To find the coordinates of point $C$, opposite of $B$ in symmetry to $A$, one can add vectors to points to reach the point's coordinates. Example:

$$
C = A - \vec{AB}
$$

The distance from $A$ to $B$ is the [[Vectors#Module|module]] of $\vec{AB}$.

### Is P inside ABC?

To check if a point $P$ is inside a triangle of points $A,B,C$. build $\vec{AB}, \vec{AC}, \vec{AP}$. Having:

$$
\vec{AP} = h\vec{AB} + k\vec{AC}
$$

$h > 0$
$k > 0$
$h + k < 1$

> if $h+k=1$ then $P$ is exactly on the border

## Coordinates

### Polar

Polar coordinates are defined using a radius $r$ and an angle $\alpha$. The point is the intersection between the [[Lines|line]] traced from the origin with angle $\alpha$ and the circle of radius $r$.

### Cartesian

I don't think I have to explain these...

### Conversion

Polar to cartesian:

$$
(r, \alpha) \implies (r \cdot \cos \alpha, r \cdot \sin \alpha)
$$

Cartesian to polar:

$$
(x, y) \implies ( \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }, \pm \cos^{-1} \frac{x}{r} )
$$

### [[🔎]] Examples

Having $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$:

$$
\begin{align}
||\vec{x}|| &= \sqrt{ 3^2 + 1^2 } = \sqrt{ 10 } \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 10 }} \cdot \vec{x} &= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{3}{\sqrt{ 10 }} \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 10 }}
\end{bmatrix} \implies \sqrt{ 0.9 + 0.1 } = 1
\end{align}
$$

---

Having a vector $\vec{v}$ with module $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{ 10 }$, change the module to be $k=7$ maintaining its direction:

[[🛠️]] The problem can be resolved using a versor:

$$
\left( \frac{1}{||\vec{v}||} \cdot k\right) \cdot \vec{v}
$$

## Secant

The secant is defined as the line that bisects the angle between two [[Vectors|vectors]].

If both vectors have equal [[Vectors#Module|module]], then the secant is defined as the [[Vectors#Sum|sum]] of the vectors.

Otherwise, a [[Vectors#Versor|versor]] that satisfies $||\vec{v}|| = ||\vec{u}||$ needs to be used:

$$
k \cdot \vec{v} = \vec{x} : ||\vec{x}|| = ||\vec{u}||
$$

## Projection

### Vector on vector

The projection [[Vectors|vector]] is the only vector that is orthogonal to the projection base and touches the endpoint of the vector you want to project:

$$
(\vec{b} - k\vec{a}) \cdot \vec{a} = 0
$$

where $k$ is:

$$
k = \frac{\vec{b} \cdot \vec{a}}{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{a}}
$$

defining the projection of $\vec{b}$ onto $\vec{a}$, being $b'$, as a [[Vectors#Linear Combination|LC]] of $\vec{a}$:

$$
pro(\vec{b}, \vec{a}) = \frac{\vec{b} \cdot \vec{a}}{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{a}} \cdot \vec{a}
$$

### Point on vector

Having three points $A,B,P$ and a vector $\vec{AB}$ as the base, $\vec{AH}$ is the [[#Vector on vector|vectorial projection]] of $\vec{AP}$ onto $\vec{AB}$ such that $A + \vec{AH} = H$.

Now $\vec{AB}$ being $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{AP}$ being $\vec{b}$:

The vector starting from $P$ and ending at $H$ is defined as:

$$
\vec{PH} = pro(\vec{b}, \vec{a}) - \vec{b}
$$

The distance from the **origin point** to the projected point is:

$$
||ka|| = ||\vec{b}|| \cdot \cos \alpha
$$

> in [[_physics.index|physics]] this is the $x$ component

The [[Vectors#Module|module]] of $\vec{PH}$ can also be defined as:

$$
||\vec{PH}|| = ||\vec{b}|| \cdot \sin \alpha= \frac{|\vec{b} \times \vec{a}|}{||\vec{a}||}
$$

> in 2D the output vector of the cross product is interpreted as a scalar so the absolute value notation is more appropriate. In 3D it is $||\vec{b} \times \vec{a}||$.

> this module is actually derived from the vector parallel to $\vec{PH}$

> in [[_physics.index|physics]] this is the $y$ component

## Cross Product in Vectorial Geometry

The [[Vectors#Cross Product|Cross Product]] has a variety of uses in vectorial geometry.

### Area of parallelogram

The [[Vectors#Module|module]] of the result vector of the cross product returns the area of the parallelogram defined by the two operands.

### Quick algo. to build an orthogonal vector

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\
x_{3}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{2}x_{3} \\
x_{1}x_{3} \\
-2x_{1}x_{2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Build a vector orthogonal to a plane $\mathbb{R}^3$

The result of the [[Vectors#Cross Product|Cross Product]] operation is a vector orthogonal to the plane generated by the two operands.

### Cross Product Theorem

The theorem is defined as:

$$
||\vec{u} \times \vec{v}|| = ||\vec{u}|| \cdot ||\vec{v}|| \cdot \sin \alpha
$$

defining $\sin \alpha$ as:

$$
\sin \alpha = \frac{||\vec{u} \times \vec{v}||}{||\vec{u}|| \cdot ||\vec{v}||}
$$

$\sin \alpha$ is the [[Vectors#Module|module]] of the [[#Point on vector|projection vector]] defining the height of the triangle generated by the two operands.

### Uses in $\mathbb{R}^2$

[[👁️]] this operation can also be performed in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this space, the vector returned by the cross product is treated like a scalar value since the result will be:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
x
\end{bmatrix}
$$

> in this case use $|\vec{v}|$ instead of $||\vec{v}||$ since it's more appropriate for the scalar context.

Similar to $\mathbb{R}^3$, $x$ (basically being the [[Vectors#Module|module]] of the result vector of the cross product) is the area of the parallelogram defined by the two operands and also provides the orientation (sign) of that of the two vectors in relation to each other. This can be interpreted as the orientation of the points used to create the vectors:

- if $x > 0 \text{ or } A > 0 \implies$ anti-clockwise
- if $x < 0 \text{ or } A < 0 \implies$ clockwise
- if $x = 0 \text{ or } A = 0 \implies$ the point is on the vector / vectors are [[Vectors#Dependency|LD]].

## Triple Product in Vectorial Geometry

The [[Vectors#Triple Product|Triple Product]] has a variety of uses in vectorial geometry.

### Volume

The triple product is used to calculate the **volume** of the parallelepiped defined by $\vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c}$.

### Are 3 vectors LI?

Given three vectors, check if they are [[Vectors#Dependency|LI]].

If the [[Vectors#Triple Product|Triple Product]] returns `0` they are **not** linearly dependent, otherwise they are.

### Orientation

If the [[Vectors#Triple Product|Triple Product]] is $> 0$, the ternary is **DX** and the points are counter-clockwise.
If the [[Vectors#Triple Product|Triple Product]] is $< 0$, the ternary is **SX** and the points are clockwise.

### Find $H$ projection of $P$ onto plane $ABC$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$

The [[#Projection|projection]] $H$ can be viewed as:

$$
H = P + \vec{PH}
$$

where:

$$
\vec{PH} = \vec{KA} = -\vec{AK}
$$

where $K$ is the projection of $P$ onto $\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}$.

### Find height of parallelepiped

$$
h = \frac{|\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} \cdot \vec{AP}|}{||\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}||} = \frac{Volume}{A_{base}}
$$

### Coplanarity

#### Are three points aligned?

- $\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} = 0 \implies yes$
- $\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} \ne 0 \implies no$

#### Given three points, find a fourth that is on the same plane:

$$
A + k\vec{AB} + k\vec{AC}
$$

#### Find a [[Vectors#Linear Combination|LC]] to generate a null vector:

System equation:

$$
kAB + jAC +hAD = 0
$$

#### Prove that these four points are coplanar

$$
\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} \cdot \vec{AD} = 0
$$

### Distances

Distance of point $P$ from point $A$:

$$
d = \sqrt{ \vec{AP} \cdot \vec{AP} } = ||\vec{AP}||
$$

Distance of point $P$ from [[#Lines|line]] $\vec{AB}$:

$$
d = \frac{||\vec{AB} \times \vec{AP}||}{|\vec{AB}|} = ||\vec{AP}|| \cdot \sin \alpha
$$

Distance of point $P$ from plane $ABC$:

$$
d = \frac{|\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} \cdot \vec{AP}|}{||\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}||}
$$

## Ortho-normal Ternary

It is defined as 3 [[Vectors]] all orthogonal to each other and all with [[Vectors#Versor|module]] `1`.

## Lines

A line is defined by a point and any vector:

$$
(x, y, z) = A + \lambda \vec{v}
$$

or two points in space:

$$
(x, y, z) = A + \lambda(B - A)
$$

### Parametric Equations

To find if a point $P$ belongs to a line, a parametric equation can be used. This is similar to [[Vectors#Linear Combination|Linear Combination]].

$$
\begin{cases}
x = A_{x} + \lambda \cdot \vec{v_{x}} \\
y = A_{y} + \lambda \cdot \vec{v_{y}} \\
z = A_{z} + \lambda \cdot \vec{v_{z}} \\
\end{cases}
$$

```desmos-graph
(0,0)|label:A
(5,5)|label:B
f(x)=x|x>0|x<5

f(x)=x|x>0|x<2.5|green
(2.5,2.5)|green|label:λ=0.5

f(x)=x|x>-5|x<0|red
(-5,-5)|red|label:B' λ=-1
```

[[🛠️]] To check if a point is on a line you solve the equations system for $x,y,z$ substituting them with the point coordinates.

### Line Positions

| skewed           | $(\vec{u}~\nparallel~\vec{v})~\land~r~\cap~s=\varnothing$ | $\vec{u} \times \vec{v}\ne\vec{0}~\land~\vec{u}\times \vec{v} \cdot \vec{AB}\ne0$ |

### Are two lines coinciding?

REFAC

To be defined as coinciding, two lines must have their direction vectors [[Vectors#Dependency|linearly dependent]] and the staring points on the same line.

First, check if the two direction vectors are [[Vectors#Dependency|linearly dependent]]:

$$
\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = 0
$$

then, check if they are coinciding by using the [[Vectors#Cross Product|cross product]]:

$$
\vec{a} \times \vec{AB} = 0
$$

[[🚨]] When $\vec{a} \times \vec{b} \ne \vec{0} ~ \land ~ \vec{a} \times \vec{AB}\ne \vec{0}$, $B$ is the intersection point between the two lines.

### [[🔎]] Examples

Given:

$$
\begin{cases}
x = 1 - \lambda\\
y = \lambda - 1 \\
z = 5 \\
\end{cases}
$$

The parametric equation could be defined as:

$$
P(t) = (1, -1, 5) + \lambda \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Distances

#### Between skewed lines

To find the distance between two skewed lines, the normal vector $\vec{n}$ can be used.

$$
\vec{n} = \vec{a} \times \vec{b}
$$

where $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are the two direction vectors of the two [[#Lines]].

Given any point on line $a$ (e.g. $A$) and any point on line $b$ (e.g. example $B$), the distance between $a$ and $b$ is equal to the norm of the vector projection of $\vec{AB}$ onto $\vec{n}$.

$$
d = pro(\vec{AB}, \vec{n}) \cdot ||\vec{n}||
$$

## Planes

To introduce the plane cartesian equation the following principle may be taken into consideration:

Given a point $A$ and a vector $\vec{n}$, the plane that includes $A$ having a normal vector $\vec{n}$ is the set of points $P$ such that $\vec{v} \perp \vec{AP}$.

It can then be deduced that the vector $\vec{n}$ defines the orientation of the plane. This vector is the result of $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$ where $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are the two vectors that can define the plane.

> $\vec{v} \perp \vec{AP} \implies \vec{v} \cdot \vec{AP} = 0$

![[plane_normal_vector.excalidraw]]

Base form:

$$
a(x-x_{0})+b(y-y_{0})+c(z-z_{0})=0
$$

Simplifying:

$$
ax + by + cz = d
$$

[[👁️]] note that $a,b,c$ are the components of $\vec{n}$.

> A plane crosses the origin when the cartesian equation equals `0`

### With points

Find parametric equation of a plane defined by 3 points:

$$
P = A + s \cdot \overrightarrow{AB} + t \cdot \overrightarrow{AC}
$$

where $P$ is:

$$
P = (x, y , z)
$$

remembering that this expression must be valid:

$$
\vec{n} \cdot \vec{AP} = 0
$$

### [[🛠️]] Applications

#### Find cartesian equation of 3 points ABC

Build the normal vector:

$$
\vec{n} = \vec{AB} \times \vec{AC}
$$

then solve for $x,y,z$:

$$
\vec{n} \cdot \vec{AP}
$$

n = AB x AC => n dot AP
where P = (x, y, z)

param equation of line that crosses point and is orthogonal to a plane:
use point of plane that is given and for the direction vector use n

project point on plane:
BA hwere b on plane and A in space -> pro(BA,n) -> finds BK -> A-BK = H which is the projection of A onto the plane

define plane che passa per A e sia orthogonale a r (retta)
use line direction vector such that each component is for x y and z. then after equals we need a point that satisfies the equation so we use the coordinates of the point to substitute x y and z.
output: ax + by + cz = d
or see it also as H, the intersectino of the plane (that crksses A) with the line, where H is the prijectin of A onto the line

piano che passa per due rette parallele
find AB, vector that connects both lines then cross that with the lines direction vector
then create cartesian eq with that vector

find piano che continie rette incidenti
cross con vettori direzione e poi cartesian eq usando il punto di intersez
